# Opensauce ( NOW CALLED FUDI :) )

## This is my final app for the Udacity swift nanodegree.

When i started building this app i originally called it opensauce but it eveolved over time into Fud. It is a recipe scrapbook app that allows you to search for recipes and store the ones you like for future use.
The app is broken into 3 main sections :

###explore
From here you can either search for recipes directly using the search bar, of click on one of the collection sites to go to the main recipe sites.

###recipes
from here you can view all of your saved recipes

###bookmarks
If the app cannot save the recipe directly it will let you bookmark the page you are on. All of your bookmarks will be saved here for viewing

## Note: I have used cocoapods to handle my package / dependancy management
Please ensure you run the following command in the project root via a terminal window:

`pod install`

This will install the swifty json and alamo fire dependancies. Then open the Fudi.xcworkspace file NOT the normal project file!
